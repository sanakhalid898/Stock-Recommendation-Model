## Features

- **Historical Analysis**: Analyze 10+ years of stock price trends and financial ratios (future implementation).
- **Real-Time Recommendations**: Integrate real-time stock prices and provide actionable insights (future implementation).
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluate news and events using NLP techniques (future implementation).
- **Customizable Dashboard**: View recommendations and analytics through an interactive web app (future implementation).

## Roadmap

- [ ] Expand feature engineering to include macroeconomic indicators.
- [ ] Add advanced machine learning models (e.g., LSTMs for time series).
- [ ] Incorporate portfolio optimization algorithms.
- [ ] Enhance the web interface with interactive visualizations.
- [ ] Implement risk management features (e.g., stop-loss recommendations).
